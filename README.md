# Boolean-Logic-and-Circuits
Project for Formal Systems Course
We have provided code for a simple Boolean circuit simulator written in C. This includes a small test program that demonstrates the use of the simulator API to setup a circuit and test it on some input(s).
Your assignment is to create and test the following circuits using the simulator frame- work:

For each circuit, your program should have a function that creates and returns the circuit.
Note that the simulator we provide does not implement NOR and NAND gates. You are welcome to extend our code and implement the other gates, or use the relevant equivalences (algebraic identities) to transform the circuit into an equivalent one. Explain how you handled this in your README.
You also need code to test a circuit on all possible combinations of its inputs. You can write this to handle any circuit, or have different versions for circuits with different numbers of inputs as necessary. You will need to create this based on the example in our code. Your main function should create and test all the circuits on all possible combinations of their inputs, printing informative messages.
